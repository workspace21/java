# Java OOPs Concepts
   Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
   The Java programming language is a high-level, object-oriented and general-purpose computer programming language
   A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
   You can use Java to write computer applications that play games, store data or do any of the thousands of other things computer software can do.
   It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation
