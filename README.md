# Java OOPs Concepts
   Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
   The Java programming language is a high-level, object-oriented and general-purpose computer programming language
   A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
   You can use Java to write computer applications that play games, store data or do any of the thousands of other things computer software can do.
   It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation

CLASS
	In java a class is a blue print from which individual objects are created.
A Java class can contain:
FILDS are variables (data) that are local to the class.
CONSTRUCTORS are methods that initialize an instance of the class. Constructors often sets the values of fields in the given instance.
METHODS are operations that the class or instances of that class can perform.

METHOD OVERLOADING
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

METHOD OVERRIDING
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.
